HTML Sourdough
==============

Your modern HTML website and app starter.

Use [Bower](http://twitter.github.com/bower/) for package management.

## What?

This is how I start things. This was the lowest common denominator for
me. 

## wat?!

Clone and then add your shit via Bower. run `sh build.sh` to do some 
things. If those _things_ aren't enough, write some `./scripts` and
do more things.

## O_o

You should probably use Grunt or Brunch or Yeoman.
